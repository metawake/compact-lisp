# Compact-lisp

CompactLisp is a tiny interpreter of LISP. It supports a few LISP functions 
and the project will eventually have more features. I am thinking of moving
closer to Scheme implementation.
I basically do this as a workout project to grasp both building interpreters
and to understand LISP better.
I am also considering to add some basic async features too.
